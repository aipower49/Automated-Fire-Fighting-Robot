# 🔥 Fire Fighting Robot

A mini project developed as part of my college coursework to demonstrate the capabilities of an autonomous fire-detecting and extinguishing robot. The robot is designed using Arduino and sensors to locate and extinguish a fire source using a fan-based mechanism.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Fire Fighting Robot is built to:

- Detect the presence of fire using IR flame sensors.
- Move autonomously toward the fire.
- Extinguish the flame using a mounted fan system.
- Provide real-time feedback through LEDs and buzzer alerts.

## 🛠️ Hardware Components

- Arduino UNO
- IR Flame Sensors
- L293D Motor Driver Module
- DC Motors with Wheels
- Fan (for fire extinguishing)
- 9V Battery
- Buzzer
- LEDs
- Jumper wires and a chassis

## 💡 Working Principle

The robot continuously scans for flames using its sensors. Once a flame is detected:

1. It determines the direction of the flame.
2. Navigates toward the fire source using motor controls.
3. Once within range, activates a fan to extinguish the flame.
4. Sounds a buzzer and activates LED indicators upon successful fire detection.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Embedded systems design
